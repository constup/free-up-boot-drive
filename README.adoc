= Free up Boot Drive

== Introduction

This is a set of instructions and guides on how to free up space on your boot drive by moving applications, their
configuration and logs to other drives. It is primarily intended for Windows users.

[NOTE]
.*Scope of these guides:*
====
Instructions listed here are meant to be simple solutions, which are either buried somewhere inside the official
documentation of tools which are covered here, and/or are simple solutions which are tested and confirmed to work.

Although alternative solutions might exist, *it is not the intention* of these guides to list them all - and become the
same blob of information as many of the official documentations are. However, each article will have links to the
official documentation itself and/or relevant 3rd party guides - just in case you want to dig deeper or find alternative
solutions.
====

[NOTE]
.*Supported versions of applications:*
====
Instructions listed here are relevant to versions of the applications which are the most recent at the time of writing.
If the information gets outdated for a new version of some application, it will be updated.

There is no guarantee that legacy information will be preserved. In fact, only in rare cases where it extremely makes
sense will the old instructions be kept.

== Scripts

Some of the guides in this repository also have helpful PowerShell scripts which are intended to speed up migrations of
files out of your boot drive. You don't have to use them, as all operations required for a migration can be done
manually.

However, if you do want to use them, first install the prerequisites:

* Microsoft PowerShell 7: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4
* Microsoft .NET: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net80
