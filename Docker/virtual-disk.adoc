= Virtual disk for WSL2
:toc:
:toclevels: 5

== Space savings

* Can be anywhere from several GB to a few dozen GB. (24 GB in my case)

== What are these files

Virtual disk for Docker Desktop WSL2.

== Default locations

* `%LocalAppData%\Docker\wsl`

== How to move them

This can be easily done from the Docker Desktop GUI directly. Simply go to `Settings > Resources`, change the value of
the `Disk image location`, click `Apply & Restart` button and wait. Docker Desktop will then shut down the Docker
engine, migrate the virtual disk and start the engine again.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Depending on the size of your Docker virtual disk and the speed of your physical drives, this can take several minutes.
Just wait until the Docker Desktop reports that the engine is up again.
