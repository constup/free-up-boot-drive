== Introduction

https://pytorch.org/hub/[PyTorch hub], or, just Torch hub is a repository of pre-trained AI models. Similar to
link:../huggingface/huggingface.adoc[Huggingface], it has a cache directory with gigabytes of data stored in user's
home directory. This is a list of default locations of boot drive files and links to guides on how to migrate them to a
non-boot drive.
